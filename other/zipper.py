# Version Zipper, made by Creeper
# This zips the folders you want in a directory.
# This works on both Windows and Unix-based OSes.
# You can define regex matched files you want this zipper to ignore on line 7.
# Line 8 is for the paths you want to zip. By default, this zipper is going to be placed in folder1/folder2/zipper. The 'paths_to_zip' are under folder1/datapack and folder1/resourcepack. You can change line 33 if you want to change this file structure.
